## Description
A game of 2 player tictactoe. The game keeps track of the wins and loses for each player. Also, you can add images to the "Images" folder or just use the ones provided to select different backgrounds. I made the application for an adorable little girl my friends adopted.  

## Project Details
While follwing an online tutorial on C# this application was started. Additional features added were customizable backgrounds, player score count, and improved visuals.
